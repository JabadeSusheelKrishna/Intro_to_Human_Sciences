Sure, let's break down the concepts of Auguste Comte and positivist philosophy in simpler terms:

1. **Auguste Comte and Positivist Philosophy**: Auguste Comte was a French philosopher who believed in positivism, which is a way of understanding the world based on observable facts and scientific principles.

2. **Universalism from the Enlightenment Tradition**: This means that Comte believed in ideas that apply universally to all people and societies, influenced by the Enlightenment period's focus on reason and progress.

3. **Formulation of Universal Laws**: Comte argued that there are fundamental laws governing human behavior and society that can be discovered through observation and study.

4. **Three Stages of Human Knowledge**: Comte proposed that human understanding progresses through three stages:
   - Theological or Fictitious Stage: This is when people explain things through religious or imaginary beliefs.
   - Metaphysical or Abstract Stage: People start to look for abstract explanations beyond just religious beliefs.
   - Scientific or Positive Stage: This is the stage of modern science, where knowledge is based on observation, experimentation, and evidence.

5. **Knowledge Generation through Observation and Experience**: Comte believed that knowledge comes from observing the world and gaining experience, rather than relying solely on abstract ideas or religious beliefs.

6. **Interest in General Laws, not Individual Facts**: Instead of focusing on specific events or details, Comte was interested in discovering general patterns and laws that apply across different situations.

7. **Method of Induction**: Comte advocated for using the method of induction, which involves drawing general conclusions from specific observations or examples. For example, if we observe that all observed instances of a phenomenon behave in a certain way, we might induce a general law or principle governing that phenomenon.

In essence, Comte's positivist philosophy emphasizes the importance of scientific observation and the search for universal laws to understand and explain the world around us.

The empiricist tradition is another important philosophical approach that emphasizes the role of experience and observation in gaining knowledge. Here's a simpler explanation:

1. **What is Empiricism?**: Empiricism is a philosophical idea that suggests knowledge comes primarily from sensory experience. This means we learn about the world through what we see, hear, touch, taste, and smell.

2. **Key Thinkers**: Empiricism has been championed by philosophers like John Locke, David Hume, and George Berkeley, among others.

3. **Sensory Experience as Foundation**: Empiricists believe that all knowledge begins with sensory experiences. For example, if you touch something hot and get burned, you learn through that experience not to touch hot things.

4. **Rejecting Innate Ideas**: Empiricists typically reject the idea of innate ideas, which are ideas that people are born with. Instead, they argue that all knowledge comes from experiences accumulated after birth.

5. **Importance of Observation and Experimentation**: Empiricists value observation and experimentation as crucial tools for gaining knowledge. For instance, scientific experiments allow us to test hypotheses and gather evidence to support our understanding of the world.

6. **Role of Perception and Sensation**: Empiricists emphasize the role of perception and sensation in shaping our understanding of reality. They believe that our senses provide us with raw data that our minds then organize and interpret.
 
7. **Critiques of Empiricism**: Critics of empiricism argue that not all knowledge can be gained through sensory experience alone. They point out that some concepts, such as mathematical truths or moral principles, may not be reducible to sensory experiences.

In summary, the empiricist tradition holds that our knowledge of the world is based primarily on what we observe and experience through our senses, and that observation and experimentation are crucial for understanding the world around us.

The Rankian tradition, named after the German historian Leopold von Ranke, revolutionized the way history is studied and understood. Let's simplify the key points:

1. **Beginning of Modern Historiography**: Leopold von Ranke is considered the father of modern historiography. He brought about a new approach to studying history that emphasized accuracy and objectivity.

2. **Isolation of the Past from the Present**: Ranke believed that to truly understand history, one must study it in isolation from the biases and perspectives of the present. This means avoiding imposing current ideas or values onto historical events.

3. **Reliance on Sources**: Ranke stressed the importance of using primary sources—documents, artifacts, and records from the time period being studied—as the basis for historical analysis. He believed that historians should rely on these sources to reconstruct the past as accurately as possible.

4. **Not All Sources Are Equal**: Ranke understood that not all sources are equally reliable or valuable. Some may be biased or inaccurate, while others may provide more objective insights. Historians must critically evaluate and compare multiple sources to get a clearer picture of what actually happened.

5. **Emphasis on Providing References**: Ranke emphasized the importance of citing sources and providing references in historical writing. This ensures transparency and allows readers to verify the accuracy of the information presented.

6. **Primacy of Facts**: Ranke prioritized factual accuracy in historical research and writing. He believed that historians should focus on presenting the facts of history objectively, without embellishment or interpretation.

In essence, the Rankian tradition introduced a rigorous and systematic approach to studying history, emphasizing the use of primary sources, the importance of objectivity, and the primacy of factual accuracy.

Sure, let's break down each part of the information:

1. **Historical Positivism of 19th Century**: This refers to a way of thinking about history that was common in the 1800s. Positivism is a belief that knowledge comes from observable facts and experiences, rather than speculation or theory.

2. **The Rankian Call: "Wie es eigentlich gewesen"**: This phrase means "how it actually was" in German. It's associated with a historian named Leopold von Ranke, who emphasized the importance of presenting history as accurately as possible, based on evidence.

3. **Claiming History as a Science**: This means treating history as a field of study that follows scientific methods, such as gathering evidence, making observations, and drawing conclusions based on evidence.

4. **Aligned with the British Empiricist Tradition**: This refers to the philosophical tradition in Britain that emphasizes the importance of sensory experience and observation in gaining knowledge. In historical positivism, this means relying on facts and evidence that can be observed or experienced.

5. **Facts are like Sense-Impressions**: This means that historical facts are perceived in a similar way to how we perceive sensory information, like what we see, hear, or touch. In other words, historical facts should be observable and based on evidence.

6. **Their Reception is a Passive Act**: This means that people receive historical facts without actively shaping or influencing them. Instead, they accept facts as they are presented, much like how we might passively receive sensory information without actively changing it.

7. **A Common-Sense View of History**: This refers to an approach to history that seems reasonable and logical based on everyday understanding or common sense. It's about presenting history in a way that seems straightforward and believable to most people.

**Example**: Imagine you're reading a history book about World War II. A historian who follows historical positivism might present facts about battles, dates, and leaders based on documents, eyewitness accounts, and other evidence. They would strive to present these facts objectively, without bias or speculation. This approach aligns with the idea of history as a science, where evidence is collected and analyzed to understand past events accurately. And readers would passively receive this information, accepting it as true based on the evidence presented.
